# Junior Frontend Developer Assignment

## Objective

The goal of this task is to evaluate skills in creating a React application using Redux (Classic Redux or Redux Toolkit) and TypeScript. The application includes a user management table with advanced filtering and type safety.

## Features

1. **User Management Table**:

   - Displays user information fetched from a mock API.
   - Includes columns for Name, Username, Email, and Phone.

2. **Advanced Filtering**:

   - Search inputs for each column (Name, Username, Email, Phone).
   - Dynamic updates of the table based on user input in these fields.

3. **State Management**:

   - Uses Redux to manage application state (user data and filter states).

4. **Type Safety**:

   - Comprehensive use of TypeScript to ensure type safety and reduce runtime errors.

5. **Design and Styling**:
   - User-friendly and visually appealing table and search inputs.
